# Apply Restriction

The Card Limit and Restriction API is REST-based and employs Basic and ApiKey authentication. The API endpoints accept JSON-encoded request bodies, return JSON-encoded responses and use standard HTTP response codes.

All resources are located in the Shell Card Platform.  The Shell Card Platform is the overall platform that encompasses all the internal Shell systems used to manage resources. The internal workings of the platform are not important when interacting with the API. However, it is worth noting that the platform uses a microservice architecture to communicate with various backend systems and some API calls are processed asynchronously.

All endpoints use the `POST` verb for retrieving, updating, creating and deleting resources in the Shell Card Platform. The endpoints that retrieve resources from the Shell Card Platform allow flexible search parameters in the API request body.

**Important Note** - This operation allows setting or updating the restrictions on existing cards. (For up to 3 cards in a single call).

All restrictions of the cards are submitted and executed after successful below condition.
•    The card exists.
•    Day time restriction cannot be set to restrict the use of a card on all days of the week i.e., the values for all the days in the restriction cannot be set to false.
•    Either of the usage, daytime, location or product restriction ‘Reset’ is set to ‘True’ or applied on the card.
•    All the limits in the usage restriction profile for a card is not set to ‘0’/null.
•    If IsVelocityCeiling is ‘true’, API will validate below condition:
Usage restrictions for a card are lower than Customer Card Type level limits, if there are no customer level overrides available then lower than OU card type limits.
•    In usage restrictions, the limits per transaction should be less than or equal to Daily, Daily should be less than or equal to Weekly, Weekly should be less than or equal to Monthly, Monthly should be less than or equal to Yearly (Annually). Exception being null/blank will be skipped. i.e., Daily value should be less than equal to Monthly value if Weekly value is null/blank. Lifetime limit is not considered for usage restrictions limits validation.
•    Apply the card type limit to Gateway when a value is NULL in the input. However, if the card type limit is NULL for the same field, then no limit will be applied in Gateway.
•    If ‘SetDefaultOnVelocityUpdate’ is ‘true’ then the operation will apply customer cardtype or OU level velocity limits on existing cards when restrictions are modified without providing custom values for all fields.

```ruby
def apply_restriction(apikey,
                      request_id,
